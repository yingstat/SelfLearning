## immunity related
#### Modeling human adaptive immune responses with tonsil organoids
Most of what we know about adaptive immunity has come from inbred mouse studies, using methods that are often difficult or impossible to confirm in humans. In addition, vaccine responses in mice are often poorly predictive of responses to those same vaccines in humans. Here we use human tonsils, readily available lymphoid organs, to develop a functional organotypic system that recapitulates key germinal center features in vitro, including the production of antigen-specific antibodies, somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, plasmablast differentiation and class-switch recombination.

#### A robust unsupervised machine-learning method to quantify the morphological heterogeneity of cells and nuclei
Cell morphology encodes essential information on many underlying biological processes. It is commonly used by clinicians and researchers in the study, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of human diseases. Quantification of cell morphology has seen tremendous advances in recent years. However, effectively defining morphological shapes and evaluating the extent of morphological heterogeneity within cell populations remain challenging. Here we present a protocol and software for the analysis of cell and nuclear morphology from fluorescence or bright-field images using the VAMPIRE algorithm (https://github.com/kukionfr/VAMPIRE_open).
