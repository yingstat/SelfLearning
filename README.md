## Shell&R learning
We are a small Shell&R self-study group in UDE. This repository contains the books and the "sharing talks" we have for Shell&R learning.

The type of our learning is "sharing style". Every two weeks, each person will talk about what she/he learned by reading these books, or other related materials.
