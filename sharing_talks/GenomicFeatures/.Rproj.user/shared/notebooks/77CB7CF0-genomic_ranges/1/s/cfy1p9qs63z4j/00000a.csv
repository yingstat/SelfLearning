"0","# A nice feature of working with ranges in R is that we can leverage R’s full array of data
# analysis capabilities to explore these ranges. For example, after using ranges(hts,
# qry, sbj) to create a range corresponding to the region shared between each over‐
# lapping query and subject range, you could use summary(width(ranges(hts, qry,
# sbj))) to get a summary of how large the overlaps are, or use ggplot2 to plot a histo‐
# gram of all overlapping widths. This is one of the largest benefits of working with
# ranges within R—you can interactively explore and understand your results immedi‐
# ately after generating them.
summary(width(ranges(hts)))
