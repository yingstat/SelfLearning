"0","# This object that’s returned is called a view. Views combine a run-length encoded vec‐
# tors and ranges, such that each range is a “view” of part of the sequence. In this case,
# each view is a view on to the part of the sequence that has more than 2x coverage.
# The numbers to the right of the ranges are the underlying elements of the run-length
# encoded vector in this range. If you’re simply interested in ranges, it’s easy to extract
# out the underlying ranges:
ranges(min_cov2)
