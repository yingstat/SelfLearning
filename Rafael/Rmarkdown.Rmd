```

### Key points

- The knitr package is used to compile R markdown documents.
- The first time you click the "knit" button on the editor pane a pop-up window will prompt you to install packages, but after that is completed, the button will automatically knit your document.
- github_document gives a .md file, which will give the best presentation on GitHub
