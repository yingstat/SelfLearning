### Key points

  - The knitr package is used to compile R markdown documents.
  - The first time you click the “knit” button on the editor pane a
    pop-up window will prompt you to install packages, but after that is
    completed, the button will automatically knit your document.
  - github\_document gives a .md file, which will give the best
    presentation on GitHub
